This project is an attempt to bring the fruits of a certain Unix(TM)
vendor to other Unix-like operating systems.

So far, these include:
 * asld - an advanced syslog(3) replacement
 * notifyd - a notification system
 * Mach ports - an IPC mechanism
 * launchd - an init(8) replacement and general program lanching thingy

All tarballs are from the upstream project release 10.10.3 at

    http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10103/

Requirements to build on Debian:
* clang
* libuuid-dev
* libdispatch-dev

Status
======

Everything is mostly(?) terrible. It mostly does not compile on Debian Linux,
and certainly will not link. Do not even think about using this for anything
serious.
